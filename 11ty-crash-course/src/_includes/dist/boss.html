        <h1>The Megapithicus</h1>
        <p>It is a big monkey that summons little monkies to 
            fight along side it. While it is considered to be an easy boss you need
            to be wary of the hole next to where you spawn. It is an instant death
            if you or any creature you bring dies. He also has a ranged attack that
            is his strongest so close the gap to get damage in! You can bring up to 
            20 tames I recommend bringing 18 rexs 1 yutyrannous and 1 daeodon. This
            allows for high damage out put healing and resistance to damge from the yuty.
            When heading in it will also be extremly cold as it is in the snow so best of
            luck and reamaber don't die or everything dies with you!
        </p>
        <h1>The Dragon</h1>
        <p>Easily one of the hardest bosses in the game. What makes thi boss so 
            difficult is the burn damge he applies it does percent damage based off time
            and will constantly be applied. You also need to be careful of all the lava that is around.
            As walking into it is also pretty much an instant death. You want to bring the same tames but 
            you need to be wary of flying dinos as he summons them and they will hit you instead of the tames
            so good luck!
        </p>
        <h1>The Broodmother</h1>
        <p>The most disturbing but easiest of the three the Broodmother. Its a giant spider
            who will constantly summon other spiders to aid her in the fight. There isn't too much
            to worry about with her just be wary your hp pool throughout the fight. As she has the most hp
            out of the three and deals some damage. With this boss though you can use either 18 rexs like 
            before with a yuty and daeodon. Or 18 megatherium instead. As they get a buff for each bug killed.
            Since she summons spiders if you kill them all megatherium get the buff. So good luck and enjoy her theme
            music!
