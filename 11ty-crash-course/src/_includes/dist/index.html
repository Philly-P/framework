                <h1> To begin this Hasn't been working for a little while I do apologize for not reaching out. </h1>
        <p>I followed the video and keep getting the error Npm isn't recongnizable.</p>
        <p>So I will be using md as it this will most be theoratical code. It also keeps telling
                me @11ty/eleventy doesn't exist. This is all in the terminal. So this will probably just be 
                html and tailwindcss. Below is actual start of project. I would have used 11ty to implement 
                the design I would want tailwind to style the text and put the text into both making a realtivly
                nice looking image. Instead I have an abomination because the terminal refuses to coperate. Plus reaching out 
                is hard because the internet in my dorm and at home kept cutting in and out. Which didn't effect
                me working on this except watching videos and looking things up.
