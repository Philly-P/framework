        <h1>Welcome to the items page! </h1>
        <p> Here we will talk about leveling up and item progression as they
            are each super important. in their own unique ways.
        </p>
        <h2>Leveling up</h2>
        <p> This should be self explanatory. As you progress in your survival you gain xp.
            This can be earned through crafting killing dinosaurs or even kiling other players.
            As you gain hp you can bump up your players stats but be careful they can only be undone
            by making a soup and drinking it. It goes into a 24 hour cooldown so be smart about your levels.
            You know you'll level up as trumpets play congratulating you on your survival.
        </p>

        <h2>Blueprints/Recipies</h2>
        <p> As you level up you'll notice you have a box above your inventory with a number. that
            number is how many engram points you have. You can spend enough to unlock new recipies 
            that allow you to craft more items. But certain items may need you to have a smity or fabricator.
            These are crafting stations that you unlock as you progress the game.

        </p>
        <h2>Crafting</h2>
        <p> As mentioned before there are certain stations one needs to have unlocked to be able to craft certain
            items. The amount of resources needed are displayed when you hover over the item you wish to craft. But 
            certain foods are recipies you find throughout the game or you can just look them up. One of these items is 
            the soup mentioned before. Getting resources is very important in this game and there are many easy ways to do it.
            the main one is by using tames that are good at the topic. for more info visit tames page.

        <p>You can also find stronger items that can be made stronger then the primative ones you are able to make. This all comes 
            down to luck though as supply drops can contain stronger items then the usual.

        </p>
        <h2>Supply Drops</h2>
        <p>For our final section we have supply drops. Its pretty much gambling but you can get better blueprints out of them.
            They give items that cost more in resources but deal more damage or may have better armor or even give just items that
            are that strong. And finally you don't have to have the item unlocked to be able to craft it if you find the blueprint.
            But don't lose it because other players will be able to steal it and make it for themselves!
