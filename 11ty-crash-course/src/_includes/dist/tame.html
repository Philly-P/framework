        <h1>Welcome to the tame page</h1>
        <p>Here we go over how to tame certain dinos and how they can benefit you in your survival.</p>
        <h2>How to tame?</h2>
        <p> So once you hit a certain level you will be able to unlock items such as 
            naracotics, tranq arrow, tranq dart, and shocking tranq darts. You use these to knock
            certain dinosaurs unconcious which then you need to keep them asleep by either feeding them naeco berries 
            or naracotics. On top of this you must leave food in their inventory such as meat or berries. Depending on the 
            item you feed them it may speed up taming. I reccommened you use dododex as it can calculate how much 
            you will need and how long the taming process will take. But some may also want to be passivly tamed. To do this 
            you sneak up on the creature with the food in you last slot on your hot bar and feed it to them by hitting a certain
            key or button. But they can spot you and if they do the taming resets and you need to start again. In recent times they are 
            adding more dinos with unique tames so if they don't fit either one look it up on youtube. There are tones or quick guides that 
            can help.
        </p>

        <h2>How do tames Benefit us?</h2>
        <p>Tames benefit us in one way defense. Such as how a parasaur can act as an alarm. You can set the settings on it to be
            able to detect hostile creatures or enemy players. Another way they benefit us is at gathering resources. Certain dinos 
            are good at harvesting certain materials like the doedicarus farms metal while and ankylosarus is good at metal and flint.
            Some harvest the same thing ,ike berries thatch or wood. But others excel at this like how a bever is good at farming wood.
            While a therizenosaurs can also farm every resource it isn't as good as the bever in that catagory. Some are just meant to kill
            like the T-rex king of the dinos. He excells at getting meat and hide for everyone but isn't as good as a giganotosaurs. To summarize
            each dino is good at something it is up to you the player to discover what and implement them as you see fit. So best of luck as your
            survival depends on them like theirs does to you. And yes you can name each dino.
